# Part 1
### The student's description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is:

Hi,
I'm running into an error on my file. I wrote the implmentation of `CarAssignment.java` and assigned each `passenger` a `driver`. But when I ran `bash test.sh` `<enter>`, the terminal gave me the error `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException`.
I'm not sure what could have triggered this error. I think it could be the changes to `drivers` but I'm not sure. I attached pictures of the error message and my implementation of `CarAssignment.java`.

### The post from the student with a screenshot showing a symptom:

### A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try:

Hi there!
It looks like your error is from the `remove` occurring. Have you considered that you might be trying to modify something without the ability to `remove`?
Try using another way that doesn't involve `remove` and see if the error occurs.

### Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that:

Student:
Thanks! I took out the `remove` method and it works now. I used `driverIndex` instead. There's a picture of my changes and my test case passing

### A clear description of what the bug is:
It looks like the bug was from using `remove` on `drivers`. Since `drivers` was created from `Arrays.asList()` in the test file `CarAssignmentTest.java`, it was a fixed-size `List` that did not support the `remove` method. To avoid this issue, it was necessary to create a new variable to track current `driver`, rather than modify `drivers` with the `remove` method.


# Part 1 Setup
Setup: A program that takes two `String` `Lists`, `passengers` and `drivers`.
Each `passenger` gets a `driver`.

}

### A description of what to edit to fix the bug:
- The error was caused by an attempt to modify a `List` that is does not allow modification. 
- Instead of attempting to `remove` from the list, it uses `driverIndex` to track which `driver` should be assigned to the `passenger`.
- Since the `drivers` list is not modified in the process, it does not produce the `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException`. 


# Part 2
### In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from your lab experience in the second half of this quarter that you didnâ€™t know before. 

This quarter, I learned how to use `jdb`. I've never used `jdb` to debug through `vim` before. This is useful for remote servers.
I worked a lot with other people's code, like in last week where I had to give feedback on their code. I liked the suggested structure on how to evaluate code and how give feedback politely. I also got a lot of experience using the shell scripts. Before this class, I'd never used `test.sh` or similar files to run my tests. I would type everything in the terminal instead.
