You should actually set up and run the scenario from your screenshots. 


# Part 1
The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom:

The student's description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is. 


A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try:


Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.



# Part 2
In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from your lab experience in the second half of this quarter that you didn’t know before. 
It could be a technical topic we addressed specifically, something cool you found out on your own building on labs, something you learned from a tutor or classmate, and so on. 
It doesn’t have to be specifically related to a lab writeup, we just want to hear about cool things you learned!
