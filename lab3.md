# Part 1
1. A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
2. An input that doesn’t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
3. The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
4. The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)

# Part 2
1. Consider the commands less, find, and grep. Choose one of them: For this exercise, I'm choosing the find command.
2. Online, find 4 interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the command you chose:
For this one, I'm choosing the command -type:
Give 2 examples of using it on files and directories from ./technical:
```
(base) administrator@Administrators-MacBook-Pro docsearch % find technical -type d
technical
technical/government
technical/government/About_LSC
technical/government/Env_Prot_Agen
technical/government/Alcohol_Problems
technical/government/Gen_Account_Office
technical/government/Post_Rate_Comm
technical/government/Media
technical/plos
technical/biomed
technical/911report
```
Show each example as a code block that shows the command and its output:

Write a sentence or two about what it’s doing and why it’s useful:

For this method, I'm choosing the command -newerct

for this one, I'm choosing the command -exec

For this one, I'm choosing the command -mtime
