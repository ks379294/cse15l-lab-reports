# Part 1
1. A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
2. An input that doesn’t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
3. The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
4. The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)

# Part 2
1. Consider the commands less, find, and grep. Choose one of them: For this exercise, I'm choosing the find command.
2. Online, find 4 interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the command you chose:
For this one, I'm choosing the

Here are a few ways to use pattern matching. With find, you can include wildcard characters such as `*`, `[ ]`, `?`, and `\`.
5. To find information about the commands, a simple Web search like “find command-line options” will probably give decent results. There is also a built-in command on many systems called man (short for “manual”) that displays information about commands; you can use man grep, for example, to see a long listing of information about how grep works. Also consider asking ChatGPT!
