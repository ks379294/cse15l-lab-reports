1. A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
2. An input that doesn’t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
3. The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
4. The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
