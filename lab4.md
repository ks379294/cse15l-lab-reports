For the lab report this week, reproduce the task from above on your own. For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step. 

Steps listed:
4. Log into ieng6
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file ListExamples.java to fix the failing test (as a reminder, the error in the code is just that index1 is used instead of index2 in the final loop in merge)
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account

# Step 4
Log into ieng6

Keys pressed: `ssh cs15lfa23fq@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

# Step 5
Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)
Copying from Github:

Using the command `git clone`:
![git_clone.png](git_clone.png)

Keys pressed: `Command +C` to copy the ssh url. I typed `git clone` and then `Command + V` to paste the URL and then `<enter>`

# Step 6
Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

Keys Pressed: `ls` `<enter>` I used this to find where the lab folder was. `cd lab7`, `<enter>` to get into the `lab7` folder.
`ls` `<enter>` to find the test file. Then I ran the tests using `bash test.sh <enter>`

# Step 7
Edit the code file to fix the failing test
![login.png](login.png)

Keys pressed: `vim ListExamplesTests.java` `<enter>` I used this to open up the file `ListExamplesTests.java`


# Step 8
Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
![login.png](login.png)


# Step 9
Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
